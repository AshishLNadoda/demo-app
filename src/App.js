        <h2>QUESTION -What is redux?</h2>
        <p> ANSWER:  Redux is a predictable state container designed to help you write JavaScript apps that behave consistently across client, server, and native environments, and are easy to test</p>

        <h2>QUESTION -How it is different from context API?</h2>
        <p> Context API and Redux difference
Redux is a complete state manager capable of allowing an app to undo/redo actions and provides advanced developer tooling for debugging. Context API is designed as a dependency injection mechanism that allows making data available through the component tree without being manually passed.</p>


<h2>- What are actions in redux</h2>
<p>
Actions are plain JavaScript object that contains information. Action is one of the building blocks of Redux
</p>

<h2>What is useSelector and useDispatch in react redux</h2>
<p>
useSelector() â€‹ Allows you to extract data from the Redux store state for use in this component, using a selector function</p>
