IN THIS PROJECT I MADE Build a single page that displays the profile of 10 users.
 
 The data is obtained from an open API  "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users"

Each user's profile contains an avatar picture, name, email, phone,  website.

The profile are 3 action buttons to like, edit and delete. Upon clicking the edit button , a modal window
should pop up and display information about the edited profile and the user should be allowed to edit the
information. Upon clicking the like button , the button should be toggled. Upon clicking delete, a
confirmation popup should display and upon confirmation, should delete the card.


 Users' avatar pictures API "https://avatars.dicebear.com/v2/avataaars/{{username}}.svg?options[mood][]=happy"



Loading Indicator
Upon opening the app a loading indicator is displayed until the data is fetched from the API and is ready to be
displayed. The source code for the loading indicator can be obtained from: 
"http://tobiasahlin.com/spinkit/".

 IN THIS I HAVE ALSO USED  CONTEXT React.js â€” Basic Hooks (useState, useEffect)
